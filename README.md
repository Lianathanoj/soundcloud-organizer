# Soundcloud Organizer

Strangely enough, SoundCloud doesn't have a way for the user to sort an artist's most played or most favorited tracks. I used the SoundCloud API to grab some JSON from their server and, using the given parameters and data, re-render SoundCloud player widgets in a standalone web application.

To make this work, you need to go on SoundCloud Developers and register an app. Replace the client_id value with the one given from the registered app.
